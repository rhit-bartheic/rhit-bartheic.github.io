      <p class="about">Hello, my name is Ian Barthel. I pride myself on being an active member in my community, while also staying ontop of being a student. I am an officer of the eSports Club
                       here on campus and I also participate in many IM's. Schoolwork takes up most of my time, but in the case that I am free from it, I really enjoy being outside and playing sports (mainly football or basketball) with my friends. I also 
                       enjoy playing video games. I switched majors at the end of my freshman year, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. I absolutely love the CS curriculum and the classes I am in. After switching from a Biomedical Engineer to Computer Science, in 4 full quarters I have made
                       the Dean's List twice. I am looking forward to continuing my education, and starting my career!
